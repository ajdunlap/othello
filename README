To build:

  make

To play against the computer:

  othello

For information on more options:

  othello -h

For testing the AI to give the statistics I gave in class regarding
the performance of the learning AI against the non-learning AI, I
would generally give a command like

  othello -q -n 200 cpu learning-cpu

to play 200 games between the non-learning AI and the learning AI in
quiet (-q) mode (i.e. don't print out every board, just say who won
each game).
